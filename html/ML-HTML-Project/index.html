                    <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
                    <p>It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is used to build systems that rely on data provided to them.
                    Instead of a specific rules to be written for a computer to do its job, the computer is given a large amount of data and it uses 
                     algorithms to discover the rules and patterns itself.

                    <h2>Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning</h2>
                    <p>Machine Learning is such a paradigm shift in the world of technology. 
                        Following provides a comprehensive comparison of traditional programming and machine learning: </p>
                    <h3>Traditional Programming: Logic first</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>In this approach, a programmer writes a manual script (rules) to process data.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Example: </strong> A banking app. <br>
                            The programmer writes a rule: "If account balance < $0, then send a 'Low Balance' alert." 
                            The computer simply follows that instruction every single time.
                           
                            </li>
                            </ul>
                        </blockquote>
                    <h3>Machine Learning: Data first</h3>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>We give the computer the data and the desired answers, and it figures out the patterns itself.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Example: </strong> A spam filter. <br>
                                Instead of writing a rule for every possible spam word, you show the computer 10,000 "Spam" emails and 10,000 "Not Spam" emails. 
                                The computer identifies the subtle patterns that make an email spam
                                </li>
                            </ul>
