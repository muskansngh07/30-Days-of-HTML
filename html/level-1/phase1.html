            About
        </h2>
        <p align="center">I am a pre-final year CSE AIML student at GITAM Visakhapatnam. I belong from Patna, Bihar, India. My hobbies include <em>reading books</em>, listening to music and spending time alone.
            I have also found this new hobby of watching films, specifically the ones that I think might resonate with who I am. Over the past one year, a lot has changed. One of the significant things I have been able to conquer is my fear of Git and GitHub. 
            These two had always intimidated me till the time I finally decided to learn this in my summer break of 2025. I am very grateful for that as this not only added a new skill to my portfolio, but also help me become the co-lead for the CP/OS domain of GitHub Community GITAM.
            I also participated in the Smart India Hackathon but couldn't make it past the pre-final round. The experience was fun and as you say: <em> There's no loss if the goal is to experience</em>.
