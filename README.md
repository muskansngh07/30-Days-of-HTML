## All the things I learnt in HTML

### Tags and their use

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tags</th>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Use</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; </td>
    <td>Document Type Declaration</td>
    <td>It’s an instruction that tells the browser to render the page in "Standards Mode" using HTML5.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;html&gt;</td>
    <td>The Root element</td>
    <td>The ultimate parent that wraps all other content. It defines the boundaries of the HTML document and often includes the language attribute (e.g., `<html lang="en">`).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;head&gt;</td>
    <td>The Document Metadata Container</td>
    <td>It acts as the "brain" of the page, holding machine-readable information that isn't shown to the user, such as character encoding, links to CSS stylesheets, and scripts.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
