    <h1><center> Violence Against Women </center> </h1>
    <font size="5">
    <p>Violence against women have been on a rise in India and it exists as one of the major disparities in the country, reflecting deep rooted patriarchy and gender inequality.
        It shows how the law and order in the country has failed to protect the dignity and integrity of its citizens, especially 
        women. Despite legal reforms and growing awareness, women continue to face physical, emotional and digital abuse in both public and private spaces.

        According to the report by <b>NCRB</b> (National Crime Records Bureau) in 2023, over 4.7 lakh cases of crimes against women were reported, showing a steady
        rise compared to previous years. The most common forms include domestic violence, rape, dowry deaths, acid attacks and cyber harassment.
        It is important to note that these figures just represent the reported cases. Many incidents still go unrecorded due to social stigma
        and the fear of retaliation. The causes of such violence lie in patriarchal mindsets, economic dependency, weak law enforcement and cultural silence. 
        Women are often blamed for what they experience while the perpetrators are given free hand. 
        The rise of Internet just adds new avenues of abuse such as stalking and non-consensual image sharing.

        One of the most horrifying incidents happened in 2024 at the <b>RG Kar Medical College and Hospital</b> in Kolkata, West Bengal, where a 31-year old female doctor was found dead in the seminar hall after her 
        night duty. It was initially reported to be a suicide but the postmortem reports confirmed sexual assault followed by murder. This crime within the hospital premises raised severe questions on security and negligence. 
        Later investigations showed that there had been cover-up attempts and lapse in the authoritative conduct of the hospital. Even the state government drew a lot of criticism for its handling of the case, theorefore the case being handed to the CBI later. 
        This incident shows how women are not safe even in public spaces and it is very easy for the convicts to get free if they have political links, 
        irrespective of how a woman's life was destroyed and her dreams crushed. 
        This case is not the first epitome of apathy and gendered violence but there's this one incident that's still fresh after so many years- <b>The 2012 Nirbhaya Case</b>.
        There was an interview of one of the convicts where he says that he didn't regret the inhumane act he did to the victim as all he did was try save the culture according to which 
        a woman shouldn't be out with her male friend that late at night. This is something which has been normalised that culture is preserved only when a woman stays in the limit 
        defined by patriarchy and if not, it is in danger. A woman's plight doubles when not only is she discriminated on the basis of gender but by class or caste.

        India's legal framework to combat violence against women is among the most comprehensive in the world. 
        <b>The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005</b> focuses to provide immediate relief and protection to the 
        victim. It is civil in nature. <b> Section 498A IPC</b> imposes criminal liability on the convict and more of aimed at curbing 
        dowry-related harassment and any form of cruelty that may drive the victim to cause any grave harm to herself. 
        <b> Section 376 IPC </b> provides for rigorous imprisonment of anyone convicted of rape for a term not less than 10 years. 
        <b> The Visakha Judgement </b> legislates the protection of women from harassment at workplace. The Supreme Court of India, in 2014, issued a landmark judgement 
        to regulate the sale of acid. This was done to combat acid attacks particularly on women and girls, that often occur due to personal vendetta or other social tensions.

        However the gap lies in the poor implementation of such laws and low conviction rates often weakening justice delivery. 
        To make these protections truly effective, it is important for everyone to stay aware and sensitive, be it towards any gender so that
        every person can live with safety, freedom and dignity.
